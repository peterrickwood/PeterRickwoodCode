<h1>CADI toolkit by example</h1>

<p>
Currently, the CADI toolkit can be used to perform 
inversion/optimisation (using any of a number of
implemented algorithms), and sensitivity analysis.
If you are a Java developer, you may also write
additional extensions to the toolkit in Java. 

<p>At CADI, work on the toolkit is ongoing. To
aid us in guiding this development, we 
would be interested in hearing on what
you are using the toolkit for, and what 
additional features you would like to see.
