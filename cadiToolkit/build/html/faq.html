<a name="q0"><b>Isnt Java too slow to do numerical computation</b></a>

<p>
<b>Q</b>
<p>
I've heard that Java is slow, and is poorly suited to numerical computation.
Are there faster C/Fortran implementations of the algorithms in the
toolkit?

<p>
<b>A</b>
<p>
This question is a bit difficult to answer. Performance comparisons
between languages are fraught with difficultly, and religious
wars seem to break out over the issue of which is faster, and by how much.
We consider that Java is <i>roughly</i> as fast as C and Fortran
for most numerical tasks. On some specific tasks (in particular some
Linear Algebra tasks) that require non-jagged arrays or peculiar
memory management, Java may perform significantly worse, but we do not
believe that the algorithms implemented in the toolkit would
run much faster if written in another language. We are happy to
live with the possibility of a small drop in performance for the
other benefits that Java has. If you are skeptical, try out 
the toolkit yourself and see if it is fast enough for your needs.

<a name="q1"><b>When I try and run the cadiserver, it aborts with an IOException</b></a>

<p>
<b>Q</b>
<p>
I have installed the cadi server just fine, following the process
described in the install guide. Everything seemed to go fine. Then,
when I try and run the cadi server, I get the following error:

<p>
<code>
$ java CadiServer<br>

....
</code>

<p>
<b>A</b>
<p>
There are two possible causes. If you see the library
/usr/lib/libgcj.so is loaded (as it is above, see the error lines), 
then the problem (on Linux/Unix systems) is caused because
you are using GNU java (hence the reference to /usr/lib/libgcj.so.6.0.0),
and, currently, GNU java is not complete enough to run the cadi server.
You need a full featured java SDK (such as the one from Sun) instead.
Basically, when you type 'java' or 'rmid' or 'rmiregistry' at a 
command prompt, you need to ensure you get the Sun versions of these 
programs, not the GNU ones. Install Sun's SDK and adjust your path 
accordingly.
<p>
If you are <i>sure</i> that you are using Suns java tools
(<code>java -version</code> will tell you), then the problem is
probably just that the cadi toolkit cannot find the <code>rmid</code>
program, which is one of the programs that comes with Sun's SDK.
You need to make sure that this program is in your path.

When I attempt to start the CadiServer, the server fails to
start properly, and complains about not being able to 
connect to a socket. Here is the error message

The technical details of what is happening here are pretty uninteresting,
so we will just describe how to fix it first, and those who are interested
in finding out what the problem is can read on.
<p>
How to fix the problem:

<p>
<ol>
	<li> Get a newer version of the CADI toolkit (version 0.3.1 or newer)<br>
	     [Actually, all you really need is a newer version of CadiServer.class,
              so you can just download the latest version of CadiServer.class from
              <a href="http://galitsin.anu.edu.au/caditk/softwarerepository/current"> the CADI toolkit homepage </a>
              and replace your existing CadiServer.class file in your cadiserver directory)]
	</li>
	<li> When you run <i>either the client or the server</i>, you need to provide
             an additional argument on the command line, like this:<br>
             <code>[/home/peter/cadiserver]%java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true CadiServer</code><br>
		OR<br>
             <code>[/home/peter/cadiclient]%java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true CadiClient /home/peter/cadiclient</code><br>
        </li>
</ol>

<p>The technical details, for those who are interested, follow.

<p>Java, by default, tries to use IPV6 sockets if they are available on
the local host. Unfortunately, IPV6 does not work (or is not enabled) 
on some machines/operating systems that claim to support it, and in
this case Java can fail to create a valid socket. The solution outlined 
above is to explicitly tell Java to try and use IPV4 if possible. An 
alternative solution that people claim will work (but which we have not tried) 
is to make sure that you have enabled IPV6 on your networking interfaces. 
See you local friendly system administator for how to do this on your 
system.

<a name="q3"><b>Running CADI Server on multi-CPU machines</b></a>

<p>
<b>Q</b>
<p>
I have several dual-CPU machines, and I wish to run my computation
across these machines. It seems like the CADI toolkit is designed
for single-CPU clusters -- can I run it over dual-CPu machines?

<p>
<b>A</b>
<p>
Yes, you can. You are right, in that the toolkit is 
designed for multiple single CPU machines. However, it will
happily run on dual machines. The only problem is that, if 
there is only one user running, it will, by default, only 
use a single CPU on each machine. 

<p>You can only get around this by creating your own text file,
where each line of this text file contains the name of a machine
that is running the CADI server. Machines with multiple CPUs 
<i>should have an entry for every CPU</i>. Thus, if machine1
an machine2 are single cpu machines and machine3 is a dual
CPU machine, your file should be:

<p>
<code>
machine1.somedomain.net<br>
machine2.somedomain.net<br>
machine3.somedomain.net<br>
machine3.somedomain.net<br>
</code>

<p>
When you run the Cadi toolkit, you should then specify this
machinefile as follows:

<p>
<code>java -cp /tmp/cadiclient CadiClient /tmp/cadiclient --machinefile=MACHINEFILE</code><br>
where MACHINEFILE is of course the name of the text file ou just created.

<p>This approach does have the disadvantage that the CadiClient will 
no longer automatically 'sniff' the network to see what CadiServers
are available.

<p>Also note that in an environment where you have 
multiple concurrent computations running, each
computation will take place on a separate CPU 
automatically, so you do not need to follow the
above machinefile approach.
