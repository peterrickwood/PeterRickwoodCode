<title>CADI Toolkit -- architectural overview</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The CADI toolkit is designed to make certain computational
tasks a lot easier. It was designed initially for internal
only use, and so has a historical emphasis in the 
following areas:

<p>
<ul>
	Parallel constrained non-linear derivative-free inversion/optimization.
	Parallel high-dimensional sensitivity analysis.
	Parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling.
</ul>

<p>
While we primarily use the toolkit to run computations on a networked 
cluster computer, the toolkit also works just fine in stand-alone 
(single-machine) mode. It also runs on normal desktop machines over
a LAN.

<p>
The toolkit is written almost entirley in Java, with only a small
amount of C code. If you wonder if Java is too slow for numerical
work, see the <a href="../faq.html">FAQ</a>.

<h2>General purpose/philosophy</h2>

Message passing libraries like MPI allow you to program
any parallel task you like, but can require a lot of
effort. The aim of the toolkit is to provide parallel
and single-machine implementations of common 
computational algorithms that can then be used 
via a point-and-click interface. 


<h3> Making parallel computing easy</h3>
<p>Common parallel programming tools 
such as MPI provide a rich framework for parallel computing,
but they require you to do all the work yourself. The
primitives are flexible enough to allow you to do anything,
but at possibly great programming effort. The philosophy of
the toolkit is to provide implementations of some common 
parallel tasks, and relieve the user of <i>any</i> parallel 
programming. Thus, the toolkit works as a 'black-box' --
you provide some of your code, and the toolkit will take
care of distributing this code. Of course, in general,
this is a hard thing to do, but for some tasks (like
non-linear inversion) it is possible.

<h3>Making parallel computing fault-tolerant</h3>

As of 2006, MPI is still brittle to failure. That is,
the failure of any single computer in a cluster brings
any MPI program running to a halt. For computations that
run for many days on many computers, we consider this 
unacceptable. To date, all algorithms implementated
in CADI toolkit will continue to work if any machines
taking part in the computation fail (with the exception
of the 'head' machine which hosts the point-and-click
GUI). You can put an axe through half the machines in
your cluster and the toolkit will not lock up, and will
continue to run.


<h3> A nicer interface for popular routines </h3>

<p>
Even if you only need to perform a computational
task on a single machine, currently this is often
done by writing your own version of some
common routine, or obtaining either source code
or library from another author and going through
the laborious process of trying to get this
compiled and/or linked with your own code. The
toolkit has the advantage that it provides a 
single well documented interface, and performs
the linking between the numerical routine you
wish to use and your code automatically at 
run time. It also provides you with facilities
to plot the results of some computations in real
time (i.e. as the computation runs), and log
results to file. You do not need to write any
of this logging or plotting code, just like
you dont need to write any parallel computing
code if you want to run in parallel.
