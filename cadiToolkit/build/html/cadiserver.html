<h1>CADI Server User Guide</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
If you wish to run the CADI Toolkit in distributed mode, 
you need to install the CADI server on each of the nodes
you wish to use in your computation.

<p>
The CADI server is essentially a program which sits around
listening for computation requests from clients.

<h2>Platforms the server runs on</h2>

<p>
Many of the following instructions assume a Linux/Unix
environment, and/or NFS. Where instructions are given 
for other platforms/configurations, be aware that the
CADI server wont have been well tested in that configuration.
Indeed, for each new release of the toolkit, we only
do release testing on a Linux cluster with NFS. You have
been warned.  

<p> If you wish to run binary code (i.e compiled fortran/C),
you can of course only do this on CADI servers that are
running on a platform compatible with the one on which
the binary was produced. For example, if you have compiled
your code on an Linux Pentium machine, only CADI servers
running on Linux Pentium compatible machines will be able
to take part in the computation. But you already knew that.

<h2>How to install and run the server </h2>

<p>
This guide assumes that you have already installed the 
<a href="cadiclient.html">CADI client</a> on one machine
(referred to here as <code>desktop.blah.net</code>) and have sucessfully
used the toolkit in standalone mode on some of the
<a href="examples/examples.html">examples</a>. If you have not already
done this, do it first.

<h3>Step 1 -- install the software on server machines </h3>
<p>
The next step is to install the server software. The procedure is
essentially the same as the client install process, and is
described <a href="install.html#serverinstall">here</a>. If you
have a shared filesystem (such as NFS), then you only need to
install the software once for each different architecture.
If you do not have a shared filesystem, you will need to
install the server software on every machine that you wish
to function as a server machine. Each machine must also have
java installed. The toolkit is only tested and known to run for
Sun's version of Java, freely available <a href="http://java.sun.com">
from Sun</a>. As of the time of writing, the GNU implementation
of Java is known not to work.

<p>
For simplicity, we will assume all machines are of the same 
architecture, and that they all share a network filesystem.
We will assume that the machines you wish to run the server
on are called <code>machine1.blah.net</code> and 
<code>machine2.blah.net</code>, and 
that your personal desktop machine (on which you 
run the client), is called 
<code>desktop.blah.net</code>. If you can get this
to work, scaling things up to a larger number of servers
should be obvious.

We will assume that the cadi server software is installed at 
<code>/import/linuxi386/cadi/cadiserver</code>.


<h3> Step 2 -- Start the CADI server </h3>

<p>
On each machine that you wish to function as a compute server,
you need to start the cadiserver software. This is done as follows:

<p>
Login to <code>machine1.blah.net</code>, change to directory 
<codE>/import/linuxi386/cadi/cadiserver</code>, and
type 'java CadiServer' at the prompt. You should get back 
something like this:

<p>
<code>
-----------------EXAMPLE OUTPUT-----------------------------------------<br>
$ java CadiServer<br> 
Using file:/import/linuxi386/cadi/cadiserver/caditk.jar as codebase<br>
starting registry<br>
starting acivation daemon<br>
launching activation daemon (rmid) with: rmid -log 150.203.8.14.log <br>
-J-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true <br>
-J-Djava.security.policy=caditk.security.policy <br>
waiting for registry and activation daemon to start...<br>
starting ComputeServer object<br>
<br>
Starting up Compute Server.......<br>
<br>
starting off listener Thread in ComputeServerImpl<br>
Compute Server started up, entering listenForCommands() subroutine<br>
Joining Cadi toolkit local multicast group<br>
starting up UDP listener thread<br>
waiting for TCP connections<br>
Compute Server bound on host 150.203.8.14<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code>

<p>
This indicates that the cadi server is now running on that host
(in this case 150.203.8.14).

<p>Now repeat step 2 for <code>machine2.blah.net</code>.

<h3>Step 3 -- Run the client</h3>

<p>Now, back on you own desktop, change to the cadiclient
directory and type 
<code>java CadiClient /import/linuxi386/cadi/cadiclient --distributed</codE>
 and you should get something similar to the following

<p>
<code>
-----------------EXAMPLE OUTPUT-------------------------------------<br>
$ java CadiClient /import/linuxi386/cadi/cadiclient --distributed
<br>adding repository /import/linuxi386/cadi/cadiserver/caditk.jar
<br>Running toolkit in distributed mode
<br>scanning network for available nodes... please wait
<br>waiting for replies from available nodes....
<br>Got reply from Compute Node on host 150.203.8.14 (arch=Linuxi386)
<br>Got reply from Compute Node on host 150.203.8.15 (arch=Linuxi386)
<br>adding 150.203.8.14 (Linuxi386) to list of available nodes
<br>adding 150.203.8.15 (Linuxi386) to list of available nodes
<br>found 2 nodes
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code>

<p>
Now, you should be able to run computations with the toolkit and they will
take place on machine1 and machine2.

<h2>Some Notes</h2>

<p>
As already noted, if you wish to run fortran/C code over several machines, 
they will of course all need to be the same platform (i.e. an executable on
one machine should run on the other).

<p>
One thing to watch for is firewalls. If you find that the cadiclient cannot
find any of the servers (even though they are running), then it may
be because of restrictive firewalling on either the client or server 
machine.

<p>
We realize these instructions are a little involved, but this is unavoidable
if you want to use the toolkit in distributed mode. After you are used 
to it, it is easy to scale up to a  larger number of machines. Below 
is an example script that can be used to start up the server on 
several machines, once you have got the hand of it.

<p>
<code>
----SHELL SCRIPT TO START UP SERVER ON SEVERAL MACHINES------
<br>#!/bin/bash
<br>
<br>machines="benioff cadiv1 lahar monte galitsin"
<br>
<br>for m in $machines
<br>do
<br>ssh $m "cd /import/linuxi386/cadi/cadiserver/; nohup java CadiServer &amp;&gt; $m.logfile &amp;"
<br>done
<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
