<h1>Requirements for binary code</h1>

<p>This page describes the basic details of 
what is required of your code if you choose
to write in a language that compiles
to binary (such as C/C++/Fortran), and you wish
to use that code with the CADI toolkit to
perform optimisation or sensitivity analysis.

<p>
You must produce a compiled object file with entry points
<code>initialize_ forward_</code> and <code>user_init_</code>. 
In C and Fortran, the
function signatures are as follows<br>

<p>
<table border=2 cellpadding=5>
<tr><td width="50%">
<p>
C -- void initialize_(char* path, int* pathlenptr, int junk)
<p>
FORTRAN -- subroutine initialize(path, pathlen)<br>
integer pathlen<br>
character path(pathlen)
</td>
<td>
<p>
This function is only required when the toolkit
is run in distributed mode. For stand-alone mode,
you must still have the function, but it can 
(and should) have an empty body.
<p>
In distributed mode, this function is called 
by the toolkit before any of your other functions
are called. The toolkit passes in an argument
<code>path</code> that gives the absolute path
to the diectory that holds your compiled object.
If your code opens any files, you need to prepend
this path argument to any files you open. You <i>cannot</i> 
use paths without this prefix
(such as in <code>open('datdir/datfile.dat')</code>).
You are required to prepend the <code>path</code>
string to your paths because the toolkit sometimes has
to relocate your code while distributing it. The
<code>initialize</code> function is the way in
which the toolkit tells your code where it has 
relocated the code to.
<p>
For C code, the path string is guaranteed to be 
nul terminated. For Fortran code, the path string
is guaranteed to have no trailing spaces/padding.

<p>For those coding in C, please note that for 
uninteresting technical reasons, their is an 
additional argument <code>junk</code>
that you should just ignore.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td width="50%">
<p>
C -- void user_init_(int* nd, float* ranges, float* scales)
<p>
FORTRAN -- subroutine user_init(nd, ranges, scales)<br>
integer nd, real*4 ranges(*), real*4 scales(*)
</td>
<td>
The user_init function is called by the toolkit
at the start of the optimisation in order to get
information about the optimisation. 

<p>Your implementation
must set <code>nd</code> to the number of dimensions
in the parameter space you wish to optimize. 

<p>The
array <code>ranges</code> must be initialized
(by you) to hold the minimum
and maximum values for each parameter, in ascending 
order (so the first element in the array is set
to the minimum value of parameter 1, the second
element to the maximum of parameter 1, the third to
the minimum of parameter 2, and so on). 

<p>The third argument <code>scales</code> can be ignored.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
C -- void forward_(int* nd, float* model, float* mfit)
<p>
FORTRAN -- subroutine forward(nd, model, mfit)<br>
integer nd, real*4 model(nd), real*4 mfit
</td><td>
<p>
This is where your code does the 'real' work in the
optimisation. 

<p>The toolkit will call this function multiple
times, passing in different points in the parameter space
you define in <code>user_init</code>, and this function
must evaluate the misfit of each of these points.

<p>The value <code>nd</code> is passed in, and is the
same value as set in your <code>user_init</code>
function. 

<p><code>model</code> is an array of 
real numbers (of length <code>nd</code>) 
specifying a point in the
parameter space. 

<p>Your function must set the
value of <code>mfit</code> to be the misfit
value of <code>model</code>. This value
should be non-negative (negative values
will still work, but some of the graphs/plots
produced by the toolkit will look funny. 
Lower misfit values indicate better models.

<p>If you are using some of the statistical routines
in the toolkit (like the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
sampler), this routine should return 
log(prior(model)*likelihood(data|model)), and, 
if the <code>nd</code> argument is negative,
should return prior(model).

 
</td></tr>

<p>
You can take your source code and produce a
shared object with the following 2 steps
<ol>
<li>Compile all your source to object format: <code> fc -c *.f</code>
<li>Create a shared object: <code> ld -shared *.o -o nativeUser.so </code>
</ol>
(The exact name of your compiler and linker may differ, of course)

<p>If you have stuffed things up with linking somehow, you will get an
<i>unsatisfied link error</i> printed to the terminal when you try and
load your code in the toolkit. If you want to save yourself the
trouble of starting up the toolkit and loading your code, you can check 
if your code has any link errors by ommitting the '-shared' option in 
the linking stage (i.e. by typing 'ld *.o -o linkTest.bin'). You will
get a link error complaining about a missing/undefined MAIN
method (this is normal, and OK), but you should not get any
other link errors. If you do, you need to fix them first.

<p>Finally, there are some restrictions to the files that
your program may access while it is running. These restrictions are:

<ul>
<li>Any files (data files, for example) that your program
uses must reside in the <i>same</i> directory, or a sub-directory of 
the one in which your shared object is. </li>

<li> 
In stand-alone mode, you must specify the absolute path to 
any input files. Relative paths never work. 
See <a href="../examples/CsimplepolyIO.html">here</a> for an example.
(Actually, you can either have the absolute path, or follow
the scheme in the next step, for distributed mode -- both
approaches will work in stand-alone mode.)
</li>

<li> [distributed mode only:] 
When you open any files in your code, you must prepend the 
<code>path</code> string (passed to your <code>initialize</code>
function) to the path of the file that you want to open.
Any files (data files, for example) that your program
uses must also be accessible/readable by the user who is running
the cadi server. Making it readable by everyone is one solution,
if the data is not sensitive.

</ul>
