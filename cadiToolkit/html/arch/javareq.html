<h1>Requirements for Java class files</h1>

<p>
You must provide a java class file with 
the following methods:

<p>
<table border=2 cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>
<a name="initmeth">
<code>public YOUR_CLASSNAME_HERE(String path)</code>
</td>
<td>
Your code must have a public constructor that 
takes a single argument of type String.
This constructor is called by the toolkit 
to create an instance of the class 
before any of your other functions
are called. The toolkit passes in an argument
<code>path</code> that gives the absolute path
to the diectory that holds your Java class file.
If your code opens any files, you need to prepend
this path argument to any files you open. You <i>cannot</i> 
use paths without this prefix
(such as in <code>File f = new File("datdir/datfile.dat")</code>).
You are required to prepend the <code>path</code>
string to your paths (as in 
<code>File f = new File(path, "datdir/datfile.dat")</code>)
because the toolkit sometimes has
to relocate your code. The
<code>path</code> argument is the way in
which the toolkit tells your code where it has 
relocated the code and data files to.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
<code>public int getDimensionOfModelSpace()</code>
</td><td>
This method must return the dimension of the 
parameter space being searched.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
<code>public double[][] getBoundsOnModelSpace()</code>
</td><td>
This method must return a 2 dimensional array specifying 
the upper and lower bounds on each dimension in
the parameter space being searched. Array elements
are ordered thusly:
<ul>
<li>[i][0] is the lower bound on parameter i
<li>[i][1] is the upper bound on parameter i
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
<code>public double getErrorForModel(double[] model)</code>
</td><td>
This is where your code does the 'real' work in the
optimisation. The toolkit will call this method multiple
times, passing in different points in the parameter space.
This method
must evaluate the misfit of each of these points.
<code>model</code> is an array of 
real numbers specifying a point in the
parameter space. Your function must return
the the misfit
value of <code>model</code>. This value
<i>must</i> be non-negative. Lower misfit
values indicate better models. 
Some statistical algorithms (for example,
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm) assume that the 
<code>getErrorForModel</code> routine 
returns -log(prior(model)*likelihood(model)).
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
<b><i>[Optional]</i></b><code>public double getPriorForModel(double[] model)</code>
</td><td>
Some statistical algorithms need to know the prior
probability (in the Bayesian sense) of a particular model.
For these algorithms, your Java class must have 
the <code>getPriorForModel</code> method. 
It is not necessary for the prior to be normalized.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><i><b>NB:</b></i> The Java class that implements
these methods <i>must</i> be in a package with the
same name as the directory in which the class file resides.
So, if the class is in the file <code>MyJavaClass.class</code>
in the directory <code>SomeDir</code>, MyJavaClass <i>
must</i> be in a package called <code>SomeDir</code>.
In other words, its fully qualified name must be
SomeDir.MyJavaClass.


<p>
Simply compile the Java code with the above methods
into a Java class file with a java compiler. The
resulting class file is the file that you need to select 
when you run the toolkit.

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Any non-standard java packages that
your code requires, and any data files, must all be stored
in the same directory as, or a subdirectory of, the
directory in which the above class file is stored.

<li>If your code opens any files, you need to
make sure that you specify the full path to those
files -- see the <a href="#initmeth">constructor documentation
</a> for details.

<li>
[distributed mode only:] Any files (data files, for example)
that your program uses must be accessibly/readable by the user 
who is running the cadi server. 
</ol>
