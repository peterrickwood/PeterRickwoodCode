<h1> Optimisation in C (with I/O)</h1>

This example is the same as <a href="Csimplepoly.html">this
one</a>, except that in this example, we read the 
coefficients of the polynomial we wish to minimize
from a file. This is meant to illustrate how you
need to write your code if you wish use your code
with the toolkit and your code reads from files.
Here is what you need to remember when you write 
your code:

<h2> Relative paths dont work </h2>

The main difference you need to be aware of
is that your code does <i>not</i> execute
in the directory in which it resides. As
a result, you cannot use relative paths in
your open statements. So, you cannot do something
like <code>open('datfile.dat')</code> or
<code>open('datdir/datfile.dat')</code>, since
these file paths are relative. Instead, the
CADI toolkit calls the <code>initialize</code>
function in your code, and passes in the
full (alsolute) path to the directory in
which your code resides. You need to
prepend this path to all your open statements. 

<p>
Here is the complete C code for our example:

<table border=2>
<tr><td>
<p>
<code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br>
<br>
/* these are the polynomial coefficients that *<br>
 * we will read from file. */<br>
static int x3 = 0; <br>
static int x2 = 0; <br>
static int x1 = 0; <br>
<br>
/* This is where we remember the path to prepend *
 * to our file open statements. */
static char* prepend = NULL; <br>
<br>
<br>
/* This method is guaranteed to be called first *<br>
 * by the toolkit. The toolkit passes in the path *<br>
 * that we need to prepend to our open statements */<br>
void initialize_(char* path, int* pathlenptr, int junk)<br>
{<br>
/* remember the path, so that we can prepend it to *<br>
 * our fopen calls later */<br>
prepend = path;<br>
}<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
/* Set up the bounds of the parameter space<br>
 * After being called, this function must have<br>
 * a) set nd to be equal to the dimension of the<br>
 *    parameter space being searched<br>
 * b) set ranges[i][0] to be the lower bound on parameter i<br>
 * c) set ranges[i][1] must hold the upper bound on parameter i<br>
 * <br>
 * Currently, the scales argument is ignored. You neednt do<br>
 * anything to it.<br>
 */<br>
void user_init_(int* nd, float* ranges, float* scales) {<br>
	FILE* polyfile = NULL;<br>
	char path[BUFSIZ];<br>
<br>
	/* polynomial is degree 3 */<br>
	*nd = 3;<br>
<br>
	/* open the file that contains our polynomial coefficients */<br>
	path[0] = '\0';<br>
	strcat(path, prepend);<br>
	strcat(path, "polyfile.dat");<br>
	polyfile = fopen(path, "r");<br>
<br>
	fscanf(polyfile, "%d %d %d", &amp; x3, &amp; x2, &amp; x1);<br>
<br>
	/* set up the bounds on our parameters */<br>
	ranges[0] = 1.0f;<br>
	ranges[1] = 2.0f;<br>
	ranges[2] = 1.0f;<br>
	ranges[3] = 2.0f;<br>
	ranges[4] = 1.0f;<br>
	ranges[5] = 2.0f;<br>
	scales[0] = -1.0f;/* ignored */<br>
}<br>
<br>
<br>
/* nd (in) is the number of dimensions of the parameter space<br>
 * model (in) is a point in that parameter space<br>
 * mfitval (out) is the misfit that is assigned to 'model'<br>
 * <br>
 * In this simple example, we define our misfit to be a simple<br>
 * polynomial. In real examples, you need to put your own code in<br>
 * here.<br>
 * <br>
void forward_(int* nd, float* model, float* mfitval) {<br>
<br>
	*mfitval = (float) (model[0]*model[0]*model[0]*x3 + <br>
		   model[1]*model[1]*x2 + <br>
		   model[2]*x1);<br>

}<br>

<h2>Compilation</h2>

<p>
Compilation is the same as in the case <a href="Csimplepoly.html">without any IO</a>.
That is, for a single file, you just do <code>gcc -c test.c</code>, and
use the resulting <code>.o</code> file. For multiple
source files, you do:
<ol>
<li>Compile the objects: <code> gcc -c *.c </code>
<li>Combine the objects into a single shared object file: <code> gcc -shared *.o -o myobject.so </code>
</ol>
