<h1>Writing a plugin for the CADI toolkit</h1>

<p>
All plug-ins for the CADI tookkit must be distributed
as Java archives (.jar files). In practice, this means
that they must be written in Java.<a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>.

<p>
All classes in the archive must be in their own package
(i.e. they <i>cannot</i> be in a 'default' package).

<p>
The jar file must contain a Manifest with the Main-Class
attribute specifying the class that is to be 'run' if the
extension is selected in the toolkit. This main class
must either extend <code>java.lang.Thread</code> or 
implement <code>java.lang.Runnable</code>. The preference
is that you implement <code>java.lang.Runnable</code>.
The main class must also have a no-argument constructor.

<p>
You must place this jar file in a directory called 'ext'
in the cadi client directory. For example, if your cadi client
is installed in <code>/some/path/cadiclient</code> then
your plugin must be placed at 
<code>/some/path/cadiclient/ext/myplugin.jar</code>. 

<p>The extension will be added to the "Miscellaneous" menu
in the toolkits main menubar. If selected, the zero argument
constructor of the main class is called, and then the
class' run() method is set running in a separate thread.

can compile to Java bytecode. Python, for example
can be compiled to java bytecode by the Jython
python compiler/interpreter.</a>
