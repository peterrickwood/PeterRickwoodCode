<h1> CADI Toolkit User Guide </h1>

The CADI toolkit consists of 2 parts.
The client part is needed by everyone, 
and is the main program that you run.
If you wish to use the toolkit just on
your own machine, you dont need the 
server part of the toolkit. However,
if you wish to spread your computations
over multiple machines, you need to
install the server part of the toolkit on 
each machine that you wish to take part in the 
computation.
