<h1>CADI Client User Guide</h1>

<p>
<b>Assumptions</b>: This guide assumes that you have sucessfully installed
the CADI client. If you wish to use the client in distributed 
mode, you must have installed and started any CADI servers, and
disabled any firewall on your computer. See the 
<a href="cadiserver.html">CADI Server user guide</a>

<h2>Distributed and non-distributed modes</h2>

<p>You can run the toolkit in 2 different modes, <i>standalone</i>
and <i>distributed</i>.

<h3>Stand-alone mode</h3>

<p>If you just want to run on your local machine, you launch
the CADI toolkit by typing:

<p>
<code>java -cp /tmp/cadiclient CadiClient /tmp/cadiclient</code>

<p>You will need to change <code>/tmp/cadiclient</code> to be the
path to where <i>you</i> installed the cadi client.

<h3>Distributed mode</h3>

<p>If you just want to do computations over several (or many)
computers, you need to launch the toolkit by typing:

<p>
<code>java -cp /tmp/cadiclient CadiClient /tmp/cadiclient --distributed</code> 

<p>
The toolkit will then have a look on the network to see if there are
any <a href="cadiserver.html">servers</a> available for computation.

<table border=2>
<tr><td>
<code>
$ java -cp /tmp/cadiclient CadiClient /tmp/cadiclient --distributed <br>
....<br>
scanning network for available nodes... please wait<br>
waiting for replies from available nodes....<br>
found 128 nodes
</code>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
If it finds any servers, it will use them for any following computation. If
it fails to find any available servers, it defaults to stand-alone 
mode.

<h2> Step-by-step Examples </h2>

The easiest way to gain an initial appreciation of what the toolkit
can do for you is to go through the <a href="examples/examples.html">

<h2>Automatic code downloading</h2>

<p>
The CADI client has the neat feature that it automatically
upgrades itself, if you tell it to. You dont need to do <i>anything</i> 
to obtain the latest bug-fixes or latest release of the 
software -- it gets downloaded automatically whenever you
start up the CADI client, provided you answer <code>YES</code>
to enable this feature during the install of the client, and
provided you have a working network connection when you start the 
toolkit. If you have turned this option on, here is how it works:

<h3>Network class loading</h3>
<p>
When you install the CADI client, you actually dont download 
and install all the code that is required for the client to run. 
The small piece of code that you run when you run the client
(CadiClient.class) is merely a
small 'stub' program that is clever enough to establish a 
network connection and download the rest of the code it needs. 
Every time it starts, it attempts
to download the cadi software. The toolkit
stores the URLs that it tries to download software from
in a file called <code>repositoryURLs.txt</code>. It tries
each of the entries in this file, in order. If it cannot
download the software from any entry in this file, and
cannot find a local copy of the software, it
prints an error message and exits.

<h4>Example -- always downloading the current version</h4>
As an example, if you always want to run the latest version
of the CADI client, you can specify a URL like
<a href="http://galitsin.anu.edu.au/caditk/softwarerepository/current/">
http://galitsin.anu.edu.au/caditk/softwarerepository/current/</a>
during the install process, and then every time you start the client, 
it will download the cadi software
from this URL. 

<h4>Example -- always running version 0.1</h4>

<p>When you install the toolkit, if you always want to run, say, version
0.1 of the toolkit, you can specify a URL that points to that
version of the software (such as 
<a href="http://galitsin.anu.edu.au/caditk/softwarerepository/0.1/">
http://galitsin.anu.edu.au/caditk/softwarerepository/0.1/</a>).
Alternatively, you can add the line 
<code>http://galitsin.anu.edu.au/caditk/softwarerepository/0.1/</code>
as the top line in the <code>repositoryURLs.txt</code> file in the
<code>cadiclient</code> directory.


<h4>Example -- disabling network class loading</h4>

<p>When you install the cadi client, a copy of the CADI
software is placed in the file <code>caditk.jar</code>. If
you wish to disable network class loading, and always have
the toolkit start up with the version of the CADI software
'frozen' at the time of download, you need to imake an entry like
this the first line in your <code>repositoryURLs.txt</code>
file:<br>
<code>file:/path/to/cadiclient/caditk.jar</code><br>

<h4>Example -- adding additional code repositories in case one fails</h4>

If you open the file repositoryURLs.txt in the cadiclient
directory, you will find that it has several entries.
Let us assume that your file has the following entries:
<table border=2>
<tr><td>http://galitsin.anu.edu.au/caditk/softwarerepository/current/
</td></td>
<tr><td>http://rses.anu.edu.au/~peterr/cadi/caditk/softwarerepository/current/
</td></td>
</table>

Suppose that you know of another URL where the CADI software is located.
(say <code>http://cadi.software.net/software/current/</code>). You simply need to
add this entry as a new line to the <code>repositoryURLs.txt</code>
file, and the CADI client will look at this URL if it cannot find the
code from any of the other listed URLs.

<h2>CADI client settings</h2>

There is a file <code>.caditk</code> (note the period), which 
specifies some environment variables for the toolkit. You should
not need to mess with these, but you can take a look -- most of
them should be self-explanatory. This file is created when
you run the Cadi Installer.
