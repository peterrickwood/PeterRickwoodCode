<h1> Installation Guide</h1>

<p>
There are two 'parts' to the toolkit, the client
part and the server part. 

<p>If you only want to run
the toolkit in standalone mode (i.e. on a single 
computer), you only need the <i>client</i>
part. If you are new to the toolkit, we suggest you
start by just installing the client part, and worry
about the server part later, if and when you decide
to start running your computations over multiple
computers.

<h2>Platforms the toolkit runs on</h2>

<p>
In standalone mode, we have sucessfully run the toolkit on
Linux (SUSE 9.x/Redhat), Mac (OS X), Windows (XP), 
UNIX (Sun/AIX). The Linux/Unix and Windows versions are best tested.

<p>
We have only tried running the toolkit in distributed 
mode on Unix and Linux. We think that the code 'should' work
on Mac and Windows, but we have not tried it yet (we dont
currently have access to multiple Mac or Windows machines,
and testing it on these platforms is not a priority unless
we get lots of requests from users). If you want to try 
running it on either of these platforms, we are of course
still happy to help, but dont expect smooth sailing.

<p>
Also, running on a Linux/UNIX environment without NFS
is not well tested. 

<p>
For these reasons, many of the following instructions assume 
a Linux/Unix environment, and/or NFS. Where instructions are 
given 
for other platforms/configurations, be aware that the
toolkit wont have been well tested in that configuration.
Indeed, for each new release of the toolkit, we only
do release testing on a Linux cluster with NFS. You have
been warned. We'll consider changing our platform bias
if and when it becomes apparent that people are intent
on using on other platforms. 


<h2>What compilers work with the toolkit</h2>

<p>
If you write your code in Fortran or C, or some other
language that compiles to a binary, you should be
aware that different compilers behave differently, and
this may affect how they interoperate with the toolkit.
We cover only the most common (C/C++/Fortran) here.

<p>
See <a href="arch/binreq.html">here</a> for more discussion
of what you need to do to make your code work with
the toolkit.


<h3>C</h3>
<p>Most C compilers should be fine, since the conventions
are pretty well established. We have tested <code>gcc/g++</code> 
and Intel's C/C++ compiler. If you are using C++, any
entry points that the toolkit requires must be stand-alone
(C-style) routines, not in any class. The rest of your
code can of course be organized as you see fit.

<h3>Fortran</h3>
<p>Fortran compilers are less
straightforward. You should ensure your compiler appends a 
trailing underscore to subroutine names in the final
binary (so a subroutine called <code>forward</code> actually
gets an entry point in the binary called <code>forward_</code>).
Most fortran compilers seem to append 1 underscore by default, 
some append 2, and some append none. Many have compile-time
flags to let you change this behaviour. The Intel Fortran
comopiler appends a single underscore by default (or it did
at the time of this writing), and GNU's fortran 77 compiler 
(g77) appended 2 by default, though it contains a flag
to change this to one.

<p>If you are running the toolkit in distributed mode
without NFS, there are some additional requirements about
the way your compiler handles character array arguments,
but since the toolkit is still considered untested/unstable when
used in distributed mode without NFS, we do not wish to 
go into details here, except to say that Intel's Fortran compiler
and GNU's g77 both 'do the right thing', and should work fine.
We dont know about the other compilers.


<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
Before installing the toolkit, you need the following:

<ul>
<li> <b>Java SDK</b>[required for both client and server]<br>
<p>
A Java SDK must be installed on your computer.
If you are not sure whether you have a Java SDK installed or not, you can
check by searching for a directory called something like 
j2sdk1.4.2_04 (the exact version numbers are unimportant, 
but you do need j2sdk1.4 or higher. Older jdk's (1.3 and
earlier) will not work). Alternatively,
type <code>rmid</code> at a shell/DOS prompt and see if you get
a response other than 'command not found'. If you do, you probably
have a Java SDK already installed. 

<p>
If you dont have Java, you can get a 
self-installing executable from 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp"> Sun </a>.
You need the SDK download, not the JRE download.
</li>
<li> <b>A C compiler/linker</b>[Required for both client and server] </li><br>

<li> <i>Optional</i> <b>Java3D support</b> [Required for client only, and only if you want to use
the 3D visualisation features of the toolkit].

<p> 
If you want to use the 3D visualisation features
of the toolkit, you need Java3D installed on your computer. 
You can get Java3D for Sun and Windows platforms
from <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/download.html">
Sun</a>. You can get Java3D for Linux from 
<a href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/java2-status/java-3d-status.html">
Blackdown</a>. You can get Java3D for MAC OS X from 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/">apple</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Installing the client</h2>

<ol>
<li> Download the file <code>cadiclient.zip</code> from
the version of toolkit that you want (latest stable
version is <a href="http://galitsin.anu.edu.au/caditk/softwarerepository/current">
here </a>).</li>

<li> Unzip the file (using WinZip or unzip). You should
now have a directory called cadiclient. Open
a command prompt in that directory.</li>

<li> At the command prompt, type <code>java CadiInstaller</code>.
Answer the questions that the installer asks you.</li>

<li>(Optional) If you want other people to be able to use 
the toolkit (apart from the person who installs it), you
need to make the 'lib' directory writable by those 
people. Alternatively, these people can install the
CadiClient themselves instead, and each user can use
his/her own version.</li>

<li>
You're done! Now go and read the <a href="userguide.html">
User Guide</a> for details on how to run the toolkit, and
how to use it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If anything goes wrong during the install (for example, you
answer one of the prompted questions incorrectly, or wish
to change your answer), it is perfectly safe to re-run
the installer. You can do this any number of times.



<a name="serverinstall"> </a><h2>Installing the server</h2>

<ol>
<li> Download the file <code>cadiserver.zip</code> from
the version of toolkit that you want (latest stable
version is <a href="http://galitsin.anu.edu.au/caditk/softwarerepository/current">
here </a>). </li>

<li> Unzip the file (using WinZip or unzip). You should
now have a directory called cadiserver. Open
a command prompt in that directory.</li>

<li> At the command prompt, type <code>java CadiInstaller</code>.
Answer the questions that the installer asks you.</li>

<li><i>Optional</i> If you know about Java's security policy
syntax, you may like to modify the security file 
<code>caditk.security.policy</code> that ships with the server.</li>


<li> You're done! Now go and read the <a href="userguide.html">
User Guide</a> for details on how to run the toolkit, and
how to use it.</li>

</ol>

<p>
If anything goes wrong during the install (for example, you
answer one of the prompted questions incorrectly, or wish
to change your answer), it is perfectly safe to re-run
the installer. You can do this any number of times.
